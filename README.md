# Mario RL
- An RL agent plays Super Mario
- Algorithm used is `Double Deep Q Network`
- Our model has shown the improvement with episodes. 
- For good results it has to be trained with much higher number of episodes.

# Necessary Libraries
- Super Mario Gym 
```python
   pip install gym-super-mario-bros==7.3.0
```
- nes-wrappers, Open AI gym, PyTorch, numpy, basic python libraries
